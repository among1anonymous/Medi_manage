# Welcome Peepals

## Installing Prerequisites

### Chocolatey

- Why Chocolatey?
  Chocolatey is a package manager for windows that is able to install things quicky, like linux (#supremacy)
- Installation

  1. Open Windows poweshell as admin
  2. Run the following command, accepting whats necessay

  ```bash
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
  ```

  Call me if you get an error, its most likely cuz of execution policy.

### Softwares

- Git

  ```bash
  choco install git -y
  ```

- VSCode, cuz its good for new devs. Ignore if you have it

  ```bash
  choco install vscode -y
  ```

  Do setup/link an account to your vscode using github for your own sanity. It will be visible here (cant show complete cuz of wayland reasons):

  Lookup whatever software you want from the [Chocoliatey store](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages) and install via the terminal, making life easier.

### Work Centric

- Working with Markdown in VSCode

  [Markdown lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) - This will scream at you for mistakes made in VSCode using markdown. I **hate it** but its good. Ask someone how to install
